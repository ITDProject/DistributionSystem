**# DistributionSystem**

The DistributionSystem repository provides distribution system code/data relevant for the study of Integrated Transmission and Distribution (ITD) system operations over successive days.

This distribution system platform is being used as the distribution component for the ITD TES Platform (V2.0 and later), a co-simulated platform for the modeling and study of Transactive Energy System (TES) designs implemented within ITD Systems.  This distribution system platform has been developed as part of our ITD project work.  Details about this project can be found at http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/ITDProjectHome.htm. Details about the ITD TES Platform can be found at https://github.com/ITDProject/ITDTESPlatform.

Currently, the code provided in the DistributionSystem repository only runs on a Windows operating system.

The contents of the main branch for the DistributionSystem repository are organized into various folders, as follows:

* GER: Different types of Grid-Edge Resource (GER) model files are located in this folder.
* IDSO: Different types of Independent Distribution System Operator (IDSO) model files are located in this folder.
* distributionGrid: Different types of distribution grid model files are located in this folder.
* weather: Different types of weather input files are located in this folder.

The released versions of the code can be found at https://github.com/ITDProject/DistributionSystem/releases.
