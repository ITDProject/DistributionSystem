**# DistributionSystemV1.0**

This version of the DistributionSystem repository provides code/data support for the Distribution Component of the ITD TES Platform V2.1, a co-simulated platform for the modeling and study of Transactive Energy System (TES) designs implemented within Integrated Transmission and Distribution (ITD) systems. This Distribution Component consists of a lower-voltage distribution grid populated by Grid-Edge Resources (GERs), that is, by power resources with a direct electrical connection to the distribution grid. The power requirements of these GERs are managed by an Independent Distribution System Operator (IDSO). The code provided in this version of the DistributionSystem repository only runs on a Windows operating system.

The contents are organized into various folders, as follows:

* GER: Model files for different types of GERs are located in this folder.
* IDSO: Model files for different types of IDSOs are located in this folder.
* distributionGrid: Model files for different types of distribution grids are located in this folder.
* weather: Input files for different types of weather are located in this folder.

The ITD TES Platform has been developed as part of ongoing ITD project work at Iowa State University. Details about this project can be found at http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/ITDProjectHome.htm.
