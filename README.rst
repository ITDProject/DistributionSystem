**# DistributionSystemV1.0**

This version of the Distribution System Repository provides code/data for the Distribution System Platform V1.0. 

The Distribution System Platform V1.0 is being used as the distribution component for the ITD TES Platform V2.1, a co-simulated platform for the modeling and study of Transactive Energy System (TES) designs implemented within ITD Systems.  The platform allows users to study distribution systems having Grid-Edge Resources (GERs) that are managed by Independent Distribution System Operator (IDSO).  This distribution system platform has been developed as part of our ITD project work.  Details about this project can be found at http://www2.econ.iastate.edu/tesfatsi/ITDProjectHome.htm. Details about the ITD TES Platform can be found at https://github.com/ITDProject/ITDTESPlatform.

The Distribution System Platform V1.0 only runs on a Windows operating system.
